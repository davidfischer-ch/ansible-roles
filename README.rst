Ansible Playbook
================

Set of Ansible roles for deploying various services.

This playbook is covering multiple use-cases:

* Deploying a full Django web stack
* Deploying an ownCloud server
* Installing a PC under Debian/Ubuntu
* Tweaking an Ubuntu Phone (never install nfs-client!)

Most are generic enough to be usable as-is.
